        description: "(Currently In Process) I highlight my collaborative efforts with the National Security Agency (NSA) on a groundbreaking project that integrates Python, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. Our objective was to pioneer a patented process utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to seamlessly convert handwritten text into machine-readable format. Operating within the agile framework, I assumed leadership responsibilities, guiding a team of fellow students to ensure timely and efficient achievement of project milestones. Emphasizing both user-friendliness and functionality, I am currently spearheading the implementation of OCRScribe functionality within a mobile application, aiming to enhance the accessibility of OCR technology to a wider audience.",
