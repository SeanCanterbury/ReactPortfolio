        description: "As a Software QA Intern at Gilero, I designed and executed various unit and integration tests for a medical device. I also focused on the analysis and assessment of Non-Product Software used in producing Medical Devices following IEC 62304 and ISO 14971. At Gilero I've gained valuable experience working as part of a team that interacts with nearly every department within the company, working to comply with International Standards and Government Regulations, and above all ensuring the safety and well-being of the patient.",
